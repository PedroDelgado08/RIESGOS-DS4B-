My well staffed small business offers personal training for adults, kids and teens, group classes, boot camps, intensive's, workshops, and much more. We have established ourselves in our community and we are known for outstanding service, incredible programs, dedication to our clients, as well as having great marketing and brand awareness.<br/><br/>This loan will be used to continue to grow what has already been put in place. After seven great years I know we are capable of even more volume and bigger numbers. The demand for what we offer is high and how we do it is different than our competitors. I know this is why we grew during the recession when most other fitness programs went out of business.<br/><br/>Specifically this money would go to several advertising programs, with a good portion of it going to a new website. I think a well organized web site is key for growth. My vision for the new site is one that has exceptional navigation, a clean design, clear content, video's of what we do and how we are different, as well as easy to fill out sign up forms and effortless payment options. Since visibility is key I want to purchase and sell our custom tee shirts. Our designs are easy to read and look great, ensuring they are often worn by clients around town. To date these tee's have given us a great deal of advertising while making our current clients feel special. The balance of the money will be used for new promotional pieces, local advertising, and PR. <br/><br/> We have always paid our employee's, independent contractors, and service providers on time. We have never had an outstanding bill or billing issue. We are in good standing with our bank as well as with our two business credit cards, never having a payment or credit issue. We have successfully and with ease rented offices and studio space. We have worked closely with local cities and been approved to rent space in city owned property. <br/><br/>In the seven years I have ran my company I have always had solid cash flow and never needed to take other work. Personally, I have a proven track record of being financially responsible.<br/><br/>Lending to my small business is not only a solid financial investment, it's a unique opportunity to help many people realize what's possible in their lives by becoming healthy, fit, and strong.<br/>",small_business,12000.0,13.98, 36 months,410.02,12000.0,Fully Paid,0.0

So I went on unemployment. I was on it for a few months and in that time was unsuccessful at finding full time employment.  I did however find a seasonal job at the local park district.  So I took the job.  It was full time hours but only seasonal term.  I thought this was better than sitting home like a bum collecting state money.  Little did I know what headache taking this job would lead to. About a month into my new job , I received a letter from the unemployment office.  The letter stated that since I took this seasonal job it was assumed that I was never really looking for FULL TIME employment in the first place. So they now wanted me to pay them back the full amount I received while on unemployment in that time. I was confused because I thought I was doing the right thing by getting back out there and no longer taking the state money. So I fought this but in the end I lost. Fast forward to present day. I am now married and a father of a beautiful 2 year old boy. I am working full time for a Union contractor. As much as I wish I could just ignore the notices from the unemployment offices I am not that type of person. So this is why I need the money. I need to pay them off and move on with my life.

I have been a licensed private pilot for 9 years.  I am a very conservative financial planner.  I have a considerable IRA balance, no car payment, and no debts other than my mortgage.  I could fully fund this purchase with cash and my home equity line of credit, but I prefer to keep that open for emergencies and to fund home remodeling projects.    My FICO score would be even higher except for a collection I just became aware of that was posted by Time Warner.  Time Warner canceled my automatic payment due to some upgrade to their billing system.  I do not regularly read their statements and did not become aware of the issue until 3 months later.  Once notified, I immediately paid the entire passed due balance and re-instituted automatic payments.  I am still a Time Warner customer.  I was not aware this had be posted to my credit report until today.  It is my intention to dispute this collection, but I'm assuming this process will take some time to complete.

My position is √¢¬Ä¬úSpecialist√¢¬Ä¬ù I am responsible for database management and training of our largest asset management system (Maximo).  I enter work orders and track preventative maintenance items to keep our 6000 plus assets running smoothly. I also double as the Plant Managers√¢¬Ä¬ô personal assistant, due to my past experience as a VP assistant at Morgan Stanley.<br/>My monthly costs are split between my husband and myself. My share of the budget is equal to about $2200.00 monthly including mortgage and all other utilities and childcare etc. <br/>My credit cards are my solely my responsibility and I would like to consolidate them and pay them off at a lower interest rate. The first two will be paid off by this loan. The listed amounts are what I pay per month, not the minimum allowed. My salary is more than adequate to support the monthly payment of$ 647.97<br/>American express blue $8300.00 @15.21 %	 monthly payment $500.00<br/>Chase $16,000 (12k of it was from the purchase of a car) @17.24 %   	 monthly payment $350.00<br/>Discover card $5.000 @5.9% 	monthly payment $116.00<br/>I have never had a delinquent account and have an unblemished credit record with Fico scores ranging from 720 to 787. I√¢¬Ä¬ôm never late, and have paid off debt on or before schedule. I plan to pay off this loan in 2 years 3 months.<br/>We are a two wage earner household and our combined income is 125K a year. We have retirement plans that we do not wish to touch for these debts. Credit card debt is not an emergency. It would just be a great convenience to have my interest rates reduced. I have contacted the credit card companies and they said they can only reduce it by √Ç¬Ω %. That is why I applied for this loan.<br/>The loan will be automatically deducted from my checking account. I have direct deposit and $2800.00 overdraft protection. There will never be an issue with late payments, I am paid on the 15th and 30th.<br/>I will also be sending a second payment of $200.00 to be applied to the principal every month. Which I will also have deducted automatically. The purpose of this loan was to save on interest and with this accelerated payback schedule I will save myself several thousand dollars.  <br/>I hope that I have answered many of your questions.

Our mission is more than to provide a professional soccer playing environment with fun and excitement. Our vision is to become a platform for making the world a better place. In order to do that we are donating 10% of every league fee, camp, tournament, and ad sponsorship. But instead of trying to get our customers excited about causes we are passionate about, we are going to become passionate about the causes they already care about. That is why we are letting our customers choose what cause they want their 10% to support. So we???ve decided to stand for action rather than any particular cause. We want to have fun and give back to our world. We believe that the best feeling in the world is the joy of giving and we want to give that gift to our customers. We want to create a community around giving and goodwill. We invite you to be part of our vision and community by becoming an investor today. Financial: Our monthly expenses are less than $2,000 including rent, insurance, utilities, etc. Each league we run will generate $2,500 each month. We plan to start with three leagues this December. We will also run soccer camps, rent out the field, and sell ad sponsorship packages in the arena to generate additional income. Construction Status: We have installed over 17,000 square feet of artificial turf. All permits are completed and approved. We???re ready to install the dasher boards. How we???ll use the funds: We need to build the dasher boards and install protective netting around the perimeter of the field.

Right now I am just taking the bus to work everyday. Rather than getting a separate car loan &amp; upgrading furnitures by using credit cards, we decided that getting just one loan would be the best way to handle this financial need. In fact whatever will be left of the $25k loan we will use to pay-off outstanding credit card balances. That way we only have one payment to focus on each month.<br/> Borrower added on 07/24/10 > I am confident that I can afford the monthly payments on this loan. I have a very stable job and good credit track record. I will be on my 6th year with the company. I don't jump from job to job,this being just my second.

I am also self-employed.  My daughter was recently in the hospital and the bills are starting to come in.  I have insurance which does cover a certain amount; the rest is out of pocket.  I am maintaining but could use assistance since I am now soley responsible for the mortgage, cars, and business expenses.  I am not in foreclosure, have very good credit scores and pay my bills on time. In fact  I thought I had money available thru my HELOC. Last year, I secured a loan modification from my former horrible lender Countrywide, who also advised me to put money on my HELOC to the tune of  $ 15,000.  Countrywide promised that money would always be available to me.  Shortly after, they froze my HELOC and I cannot get to my own money.   I am seeking a loan of $ 5000 to use as the hospital bills trickle in, so that I can keep household and business expenses separate. I would appreciate getting the loan so that I can breathe a little easier. Thank you in advance.  ",debt_consolidation,5000.0,8.0, 36 months,156.69,5000.0,Fully Paid,0.0

I've paid down the debt by about 40% over the last year and a half -- generally making payments more than once a month to each of 5 cards.  However, within the last couple of months, 3 of these credit cards have increased their interest rates criminally.  I've requested rate reductions directly and can't get any cooperation despite my very good credit history.  It feels like I'm now trying to fill a bucket with a giant hole in the bottom.  I would like to consolidate 3 of these credit cards, all of which have interest rates at 22.99% or (much) higher.  I have a stable, management position with a very good salary and remain 1000% committed to achieving credit-card debt-free life, as I have two kids to send to college soon within the next few years.  Going through the banking system and, worse yet, the ""special introductory rate"" credit card systems have only made things worse.  This solution seems to me a real solution.

I have very good credit and have borrowed more than this for a vehicle before with no problem paying it back in full way in advance without ever being late on a payment. I pay no rent or mortgage at my current residence and bills consist of only phone and car insurance which are both very cheap, everything else is going into the bank.

I've accumulated about $10,000 of debt in the past several years, some of which originated from college and some of which was necessary to make a living in this expensive city.  I would like to pay off my credit cards as soon as possible and clear all debts before I am 30.  It's a major milestone for me, but I am confident that once my debts are paid, I can start saving for a home.  While I have this debt, I am very responsible, have been making more than my monthly minimum payments on all credit cards, pay my rent on time every month, etc.  It's just this lingering credit card debt with high APRs that adds stress.  I would pay more than the monthly payments listed by lendingclub.<br/><br/>I appreciate your time and consideration.  Thanks so much.<br/> Borrower added on 01/11/10 > I'm a 28 year old Advertising professional residing in NYC.  I've set a major goal of clearing all debts before I'm 30.

I will use the current loan amount to pay off my highest credit card bill. This will be a big help since the interest rate for this loan is about 10% lower and the monthly bill is $90 cheaper.  As for my other debts, I'll just keep paying on those myself. As for my goal to build another business, I will either save up for it slowly or simply do the grunt work myself or a little bit of both.  Thanks so much for taking the time and help. I really do appreciate it! Borrower added on 09/14/11 > I've been running an ebusiness for 6 years. The good news is I can't be fired from my job and because of this my job is really stable. I also plan to build another business in my spare time--and as said above, I'll either do it myself or save up and hire someone to help me. <br/><br/>I always pay my bills on time and respect my responsibilities. This is how my mom raised me. Treat everything everyone else owns like it's your property. Leave things in a better condition than the way you found it. And above all else, treat people the way you want to be treated. <br/><br/>My monthly debts total $3178/mo. The expendable cash that I have left afterward is around $322 dollars. Anyway, thanks so much for taking the time out to consider helping me get where I need to go.

I/we accumulated credit card debt due to unpaid maternity leave, health issues and unexpected home repairs.  The full amount of this loan will be used to pay off these high-interest credit cards.  I will have a remaining $10,000 to pay.  I chose the 60-month repayment loan option to free up additional flexible monthly income in order to pay down the remaining amount as quickly as possible.  <br/><br/>I am a professional, working mother.  I have been with my current employer for approx 3.5 years.  However, I became employed by my new company during a restructuring where my department split into a partner entity.  I am performing the same duties and have been employed in the same industry for 13+ years.  I am part of a two-income family.  My husband has been with his current employer for 4 years and in his industry for 15+ years.  My reported salary is based on my income alone.     <br/><br/>I am very dependable, with secure employment and have a reliable credit history.  I/We have had only 3 late payments in the past 10+ years, on any loan.  These late payments were related to unexpected serious health issues of my spouse.  He is now healthy and all issues are resolved.  However, we are still under stress from the increasing credit card interest rates and we are looking to free ourselves from that stress and have a foreseeable end to credit card debt.  <br/><br/>I was very pleased to find this website and loan option.

As a result I'm a little behind on getting paid and paying my medical bills.   I'm back to work, and working twice the hours that I normally do to make up for the lost time.  Unfortunately I won't see the pay off until my May 20th. paycheck.  I'm requesting this loan to help me pay off my bills until I get back where I need to be financially, which will be in a couple of months.        Although I requested this loan for a one year term, I plan to pay off the complete balance by September 2009.  Thank you so much...

I have been working with the same company for the past 13 years and am currently a manager in one of the largest store in our company. My lifestyle is simple and monthly expenses consist mostly of rent, car insurance and cell phone. I just finished paying off a 5 year car loan which was be nearly identical to the loan I am applying for. I have not missed a payment on my car loan as well as my credit cards and is evident in my credit report. Although I have been able to keep up with the payments on my credit cards, I am looking to consolidate to one monthly payment at a lower APR. This payment will be less than the combined minimum on my cards and still allows me to be debt free in 5 years.<br/> Borrower added on 08/04/10 > If you have any questions, please, feel free to ask.

I was contacted later on the issue and I made payment over the phone. I was told that because it was my first error that it would not be reported. I didn't catch the deliquency earlier but it was on a card that was canceled a year ago and I didn't scrutinize my report throughly. I am sorry.

By paying off my debt I will be able to afford paying my student loans, paying back this loan and still have enough money to be able to rent an apartment closer to work and still have money left over to save.  This loan will help get my finances back on track and relieve my financial stress.",debt_consolidation,20000.0,16.35, 36 months,706.59,20000.0,Fully Paid,0.0

I am working with a broker and found a really nice diner in a very nice area. It is a well established restaurant earning $6,000/week for breakfast and lunch with the potential for monetary growth. Once, I received the information from the broker about the restaurant, I visited the restaurant and ate there.  I really enjoyed the food and the service was great! The place was almost full and there was a diverse crowd. The current owner recently began a Sunday breakfast and is adding a dinner menu. Although the primary sales are from food, an application for a liquor license has also been submitted which will improve monetary sales. I honestly believe that this place can do a lot better with more advertising. There are three colleges nearby and the current owner have not taken advantage of it. I will use social networks such as facebook.com, myspaces.com and others as well as special discounts and WIFI internet connection to attract the college crowd. The restaurant has a website, but does not offer online orders. I will change the website so people in the area can also order online.  The restaurant has great reviews online already which should bring customers to the restaurant.  I will also increase the amount of advertising in local papers and distribute leaflets to attract more customers. I will update the menu and offer more food. This restaurant has a successful operation records and the place was established in 1986. The area is surrounded by really nice houses, many offices, a mall, and plenty of parking. I drove around and this is definitely a wealthy neighborhood and people can afford to eat out on a regular basis at a restaurant like this one.  Facilities: 2050 SF plus a full basement. The restaurant cans seats 65 in the dining room.   About me:  I graduated from Hobart and William Smith Colleges in upstate New York (www.hws.edu) with a major in Economics and a minor in International Relations.  My educational background, personal experience and career interests has equipped me with the tools to run this business. It has always been my dream to own and run a business and this is a great starter place. I am confident that I can successfully bring this business to the next level. I am currently working as Legal Assistant at a large Financial Company. I am quite accomplished in dealing with a diverse group of individuals from a wide array of backgrounds.  My current salary can cover the loan in case the restaurant does not produce what I am projecting. ",small_business,10000.0,13.79, 36 months,340.76,9999.99,Fully Paid,0.0

Prior to the recession, I was a Sales position for Training and Development.   During the recession, with lower commissions, I began using my cards to supplement my income.  The money will be used for reducing my credit card balances into 1 payment at a lower interest rate (currently between 24% - 11%).   With my utilization high (60%), I am not in a position for better terms (i.e. one is 24% interest) nor getting my balances back to zero where they should be.  (I used to have CC balances zero, paid cash for cars).   This loan will also facilitate the higher credit score and the benefits that come with an excellent credit rating.  I¬ím currently putting $2,000+ on my debt to eliminate it, but with this loan I could reduce it much faster.   It will also add an installment loan to my Credit Report and round it out nicely.    You make a little money, I save a little money.   Win:Win.  I welcome any questions you may have.",debt_consolidation,7000.0,10.37, 36 months,227.09,7000.0,Fully Paid,0.0

I have already paid off one of my student loans, so I no longer make payments on it. I have a good credit score, I just have 'low income'.

Both my parents have ruined their credit, and I have no one else to co-sign.  I pay rent and utilities and have plenty left over to make a payment with.  In fact, whatever little I can sell my car for will be put towards paying off the loan. I have never defaulted or 'maxed out' on any credit cards either.

Within the last few years with my current employer, I've reduced my overall debt by about 30%.  With the remaining debt I have at such high interest rates (IE: my credit line with HFC), I need to consolidate my debt so I can eliminate my overall debt faster.  Realizing that getting into debt is principally a big mistake, I wish to move forward by exemplifying better financial responsibilty and proving this lesson learned.  Thank you for your consideration. All the best, Nori Chia",debt_consolidation,11000.0,13.16, 36 months,371.48,11000.0,Fully Paid,0.0

I have not defaulted, nor been late on my commitments.  My goal is to consolidate my debt through Lending Club and pay off outstanding debts because I want to make a plan toward eventual retirement in the next 12 years.  I do not want to enter retirement with debts.  I have a 401K at work which is putting aside small amounts for future reserves but to be debt free would allow me to set aside larger amounts for my future.  I am a safe investment, 5 years at my job, 11 years at my previous job and hoping to receive full funding for this loan.  I'm grateful for the opportunity Lending Club offers.  In this tumultuous economic time, more people are moving their money from the big banks to credit unions.  I hope all of America will become debt free and take themselves out of the the credit card game where nobody wins but the banks.

I have no debt as I save for purchases.<br/><br/>Ive always paid bills on time, never late. I take pride in being a responsible borrower.<br/><br/>My salary for the most part goes into savings, I have very few expenses. My budget covers the normal items like groceries, insurance, phone, cable, electricity and gas. My vehicle is paid off as well ( 2007 Model )<br/><br/>Going green is a substantial investment but will really pay off in the future. Im motivated to invest in geo-thermal and adding solar energy panels. I have already paid for my kitchen remodel &amp; the Geo- thermal but decided I wanted to add the appliances and more solar panels sooner than later. Ive invested over $50,000 of my own funds and want to keep a cushion in my savings account so that is why I chose to use the Lending Club.<br/> Borrower added on 11/01/10 > After doing some calculations I see that I will be able to sell energy back to my provider sooner than I thought so I will be paying this loan back sooner than the 60 months, probably between 36-48 months.<br/>",home_improvement,7050.0,6.17, 60 months,136.86,7050.0,Fully Paid,0.0
